<p>Working with commerce isn't trivial, even more so in emerging markets like Suriname.
To face this issue head on, I've decided to develop winkri, a frontend for the Saleor ecommerce platform, Meant to be geared towards Suriname.
It is well tested and follows TDD principles.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>In my opinion, ecommerce in Suriname is not where it should be, and the ability to quickly get ecommerce up and running (Through CaaS) is a great
differentiator in the landscape in Suriname, especially considering the exorbitant prices charged for web development in Suriname.</p>
<p>Allowing small business owners to sell online, for example is huge.</p>
<h2>Problems, and their solutions.</h2>
<p>The main issue currently faced is that of payment processing, while offerings like
Mope exist, they're not widespread enough to be useful, so for the time being, CoD will have to be the preffered method of payment.</p>
<p>It is also possible to sell &quot;Vouchers&quot; that allow people to top up their online balance, however this is unconventional.</p>
